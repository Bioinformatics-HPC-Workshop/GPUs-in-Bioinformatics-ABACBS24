## Bioinformatics HPC Workshop: GPUs in Bioinformatics

The Bioinformatics HPC Workshop is a forum and workshop for connecting the bioinformatics high performance computing community in Australia. The topic for this workshop is GPUs in Bioinformatics.

This workshop will have three key components:

- availability and accessibility of GPUs for bioinformaticians in an Australia context.
- awareness and practical exercises on coding for different GPU architectures (NVIDIA, AMD, INTEL) in bioinformatics
- open discussion on challenges and solutions to GPU use in bioinformatics

Join us in exploring how to effectively harness GPU technology in bioinformatics, whether you're a researcher looking to accelerate your bioinformatics software or an administrator optimising your HPC infrastructure, there is something for you!
